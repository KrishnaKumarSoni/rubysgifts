## Production Deployment Recommendations

Based on the code analysis, here are the key recommendations for the production deployment:

### Critical Issues (if any)
- Ensure all UI improvements are properly deployed to production
- Verify chip layout uses content-hugging instead of full-width
- Confirm fixed navigation is functioning on mobile devices

### Performance Considerations
- Test chip interaction performance with 50+ chips per question
- Validate search filtering responsiveness
- Ensure smooth scrolling on mobile devices

### Accessibility Compliance
- Verify all chips have proper ARIA labels
- Test keyboard navigation flow
- Ensure screen reader compatibility

### Mobile UX Validation
- Test touch interactions on various screen sizes
- Verify fixed navigation doesn't overlap content
- Confirm chip grid scrolling works smoothly

## Next Steps

1. **Deploy to Production**: If local tests pass, deploy the current codebase
2. **Live Testing**: Perform manual testing on the live deployment URL
3. **Cross-Browser Testing**: Test on Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and mobile browsers
4. **User Acceptance Testing**: Gather feedback from real users
5. **Performance Monitoring**: Monitor load times and interaction responsiveness
