# Image Search System Improvements

## Overview
Fixed the image search system to provide more accurate, relevant product images that match the gift recommendations by implementing multiple improvements across the stack.

## Problems Addressed

### 1. **Generic Image Search Terms**
- **Before**: AI generated vague terms like "2-4 keywords for image search"
- **After**: AI now generates specific product names (e.g., "MacBook Pro 13", "Sony WH-1000XM5 headphones")

### 2. **Poor Image Relevance**
- **Before**: Used generic Unsplash source URLs that didn't match products
- **After**: Implemented multi-source image search with Pexels integration and keyword refinement

### 3. **Inaccurate Amazon Links**
- **Before**: Hardcoded product mappings overrode AI-generated search terms
- **After**: Uses exact AI-generated search terms for precise Amazon affiliate links

## Technical Improvements

### 1. **Enhanced AI Prompt (app.py)**
```python
# Updated prompt requirements
- For image_search_terms: Use ONLY the most specific product name/brand/type 
  (e.g., "MacBook Pro 13", "Nike Air Force 1", "Kindle Paperwhite") 
  - avoid generic words like "gift", "present", "item"
- For amazon_search_query: Use exact product names that would appear on Amazon 
  (e.g., "Apple MacBook Pro 13 inch", "Sony WH-1000XM4 Headphones")
```

### 2. **Improved Image Search Algorithm (image_search.js)**
```javascript
// New features:
- Product keyword extraction and refinement
- Multi-source image search (Pexels + Unsplash)
- Better search term variations
- Fallback image generation
- Detailed search logging
```

### 3. **Search Term Cleaning (app.py)**
```python
# Added search term preprocessing
def clean_search_terms(search_terms: str) -> str:
    # Removes generic words like 'gift', 'present', 'item'
    # Preserves specific product names and brands
```

### 4. **Simplified Amazon Link Generation**
```python
# Removed hardcoded product mappings
# Now uses exact AI-generated search terms
def generate_amazon_affiliate_link(search_query: str) -> str:
    # Direct mapping: AI terms → Amazon search
```

## Results

### Before vs After Examples

| Product Query | Before Amazon Link | After Amazon Link |
|---------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Apple MacBook Pro 13 inch | `k=bestseller+books` | `k=Apple+MacBook+Pro+13+inch` |
| Sony WH-1000XM5 headphones | `k=bluetooth+wireless+headphones` | `k=Sony+WH-1000XM5+headphones` |
| Kindle Paperwhite e-reader | `k=bestseller+books` | `k=Kindle+Paperwhite+e-reader` |

### Image Search Improvements
- **Multiple Sources**: Pexels (better for products) + Unsplash (fallback)
- **Better Keywords**: Extracts core product terms, removes generic words
- **Fallback System**: Graceful degradation to placeholder images
- **Performance**: Added logging and error handling

## Testing Results

✅ **Node.js Image Search**: All test products return 2+ relevant images
✅ **Amazon Links**: Exact search terms preserved in affiliate links  
✅ **Error Handling**: Graceful fallbacks when services are unavailable
✅ **Performance**: Fast response times with timeout protection

## Key Files Modified

1. **app.py**: Enhanced prompt, search term cleaning, simplified Amazon links
2. **image_search.js**: Multi-source search, keyword extraction, better fallbacks
3. **test_image_system.py**: Comprehensive testing framework (new)

## Usage Example

When AI generates a gift like:
```json
{
  "title": "Premium Wireless Headphones",
  "image_search_terms": "Sony WH-1000XM5 headphones",
  "amazon_search_query": "Sony WH-1000XM5 Wireless Headphones"
}
```

The system now:
1. Uses exact terms "Sony WH-1000XM5 headphones" for image search
2. Creates Amazon link: `amazon.in/s?k=Sony+WH-1000XM5+Wireless+Headphones`
3. Returns relevant product images from Pexels/Unsplash
4. Provides proper affiliate tracking with correct tags

## Impact

- **Better User Experience**: Users see images that actually match the recommended gifts
- **Higher Conversion**: Accurate Amazon links lead to correct products
- **Improved Trust**: Professional appearance with relevant, high-quality images
- **Scalable Solution**: System works for any product category without hardcoded mappings

## Future Enhancements

- Integration with real Pexels/Unsplash APIs (currently using public endpoints)
- Product image caching for faster load times
- A/B testing of different image sources
- Integration with other shopping platforms (Flipkart, Myntra already prepared)
